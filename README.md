Static colors for Corsair fans.

Dependencies
============

The only dependency is `libusb-1.0`

Usage
=====

run `make build`
run `./main.out`, you might need to run this as sudo.

Note: You will need to keep this running, part of the 
      weird Corsair API, so probably just put in the
      background.

Customisation
=============

There are few configurable defines in main.cpp

I am not interested in supporting the rest of their
_not so great_ API and please do not submit issues 
if this does not work on your OS or machine.
